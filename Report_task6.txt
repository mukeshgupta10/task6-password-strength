Breakdown (for mu!mu!mu!gu@PT#):

Metric                          Value	                            Points
Number of Characters (15)	+60	                            ✅ Long passwords are more secure
Uppercase Letters (2)	        +26	                            ✅ Adds complexity
Lowercase Letters (8)	        +14	                            ✅ Good base
Numbers (0)	                 +0	                            ⚠️ Adding a digit would boost strength
Symbols (5)	                +30	                            ✅ Very strong contribution
Middle Numbers or Symbols (4)	+8	                            ✅ Improves unpredictability
Requirements Met	       (length, case mix, symbols)          ✅ Strong


From this, we learn:

Longer = Better: Aim for at least 12–15 characters.

Mix of Characters: Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid Patterns: Don't repeat names or use phone numbers.

Use Symbols in the Middle: Not just at the end (like @123) — this adds more unpredictability.

Avoid Dictionary Words: Hackers try those first in dictionary attacks.

Final Score Estimate: Around 63%
(This is a solid medium-strength password.)

🧠 Feedback:
✅ Good use of uppercase, lowercase, and one symbol.

❌ Could be stronger with at least one number and more length.

⚠️ Repeating letters and consecutive lowercase sequences slightly weaken it.

Final Score Estimate: Around 85%
(High score, but not perfect due to some pattern weaknesses.)

🧠 Feedback:
✅ Excellent length and good use of lowercase, numbers, and a symbol.

❌ Weakness: All numbers are together — looks like a phone number, which is guessable.

❌ No uppercase letters. Including some would boost unpredictability.

⚠️ Consecutive lowercase and number sequences reduced the score.

Sequential Numbers                     (3+)	1 (e.g., 123)	−3

 Final Score Estimate: Around 60–65%
(Average strength. Could be much better.)

🧠 Feedback:
✅ Good basic structure with mixed types.

❌ Weak points:

Common number pattern (123) is very predictable.

All lowercase letters and a single symbol — lacks complexity.

No uppercase letters.

⚠️ This type of password is vulnerable to dictionary and brute-force attacks.



REPORT:

Summary & Learnings
From this task, I learned:

Password length, variety of characters, and unpredictability directly impact strength.

Using only names, phone numbers, or predictable patterns like 123 weakens a password.

Strong passwords include:

Uppercase + lowercase letters

Numbers

Symbols

No repeated or sequential patterns

Passwords should ideally be 12+ characters long.

Tools like passwordmeter.com help analyze password weaknesses.

Passphrases (e.g., T1me!4Choco@LatE) can be secure and easier to remember.

I understood threats like:

Brute Force Attack — trying every combination.

Dictionary Attack — trying common words/phrases.

Best Practice: Use a password manager to store strong, unique passwords.
